User Story:
User will visit homepage and view entries by image, with location (street address, city, state) and brief description of sign showing when hovered over.


bugs to fix:
1. revisit DELETE route: depending on id clicked, array is randomly displayed in response
ie: first displayed photo deletes all and shows no entries in array

solution: select particular id (return this id)

2. on mobile view in Safari: pressing SUBMIT reroutes to JSON showing only newly submitted form
